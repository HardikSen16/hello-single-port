# Hello Single-Port Application

This is a simple full-stack "Hello World" application built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and a **static frontend**.  
The goal of the project is to demonstrate a **handshake between frontend and backend using a single port**, and to run the entire app inside **Docker**.

## 🚀 Features

- Frontend served from `/public` directory  
- Backend API endpoint `/api/hello`  
- Both frontend + backend run on the **same port (3000)**  
- Dockerized application with a simple Dockerfile  
- Easy to run and deploy
